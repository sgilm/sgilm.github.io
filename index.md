Hi there. I hope you're having a great day.

My name is Sam, and I'm a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student at MIT in the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/). I'm advised by [Prof. Patrick Jaillet](http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/) and [Prof. Nikos Trichakis](http://web.mit.edu/nitric/www/). My research focuses on developing models for the problems faced by policymakers, and optimizing these models to help them make better decisions.

Before I started at MIT, I received a Bachelors degree in Operations Research, Computer Science and Statistics from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) in New Zealand.
