### Allocating Scarce Resources with a Scoring Rule
(PhD)

Many settings require scarce resources to be allocated amongst recipients, but laws or ethics prevent money from being exchanged to decide how this happens. Organ allocation systems are a classic example.

Scoring systems are a popular approach to allocating these scarce resources. This research has focused on developing models and optimization formulations that help a policymaker choose a scoring rule.

### Modelling the COVID Pandemic in Rhode Island
(PhD)

Working with a team from Brown University, we developed an epidemic model to predict key indicators of the response to the COVID pandemic in Rhode Island.

This research was conducted in early 2021, when vaccine supply was limited and two-dose vaccines were the only vaccines with emergency use authorization. The key research question was:

*How can the delay between doses be selected to best balance vaccine coverage in the population with protection levels?*


### Segmenting MRIs with Deep Neural Networks
(Undergraduate)

This research was conducted at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute under the supervision of [Prof. Martyn Nash](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/martyn-nash) and [Prof. Poul Nielsen](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/pnie002) as part of the [Biomechanics for Breast Health](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi/our-research/research-groups-themes/womens-health/biomechanics-for-breast-health.html) group. The goal was to apply deep learning techniques to identify biological structures (the pectoral muscles) in MRIs, as part of a pipeline that allows CFD models of patients to be generated automatically from different imaging modalities.

This was my final year undergraduate project, where I first dipped my toes into the world of machine learning. The write-up is [here](assets/undergrad_report.pdf).
