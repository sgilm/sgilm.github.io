In my spare time, I love to be outside. I've been able to hike on some pretty amazing trails growing up in New Zealand.

At the moment, I try to run and rock climb regularly. I have reached the state of enjoying running that I thought was impossible, but rock climbing continues to amaze me with the number and variety of body parts it's able to injure.
