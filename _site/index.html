<p>Hi there. I hope you’re having a great day.</p>

<p>My name is Sam, and I’m a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student at MIT in the <a href="https://orc.mit.edu/">Operations Research Center</a>. I’m advised by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/">Prof. Patrick Jaillet</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/nitric/www/">Prof. Nikos Trichakis</a>. My research focuses on developing models for the problems faced by policymakers, and optimizing these models to help them make better decisions.</p>

<p>Before I started at MIT, I received a Bachelors degree in Operations Research, Computer Science and Statistics from the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland</a> in New Zealand.</p>
